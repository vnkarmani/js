    <h1>scope of variables</h1>
    <p>Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables.</p>
    <pre>1.block scope:
        -Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope.

        -ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

        -These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.

        -Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block.

        -Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.

        -Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block.
    </pre>
    <pre>2.local scope:
        -Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.

        -Local variables have Function Scope

        -They can only be accessed from within the function.

        -local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions.
         Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.

    </pre>
    <pre>3.Function Scope

        -JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.

        -Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.
        
        -Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function.
         They all have Function Scope
     </pre>
    <pre>4.Global Scope
        -Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.

        -Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.
        
        -Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.
         They all have Global Scope
